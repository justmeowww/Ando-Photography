                This is where I’ll be sharing all my cosplay photography. 
                I will try to make all photos available for viewing, but not at its full resolution. 
                The full resolution download is only available to the clients.

                    Thank you for looking at my photos! If you are interested in me for your next photoshoot, you should know that most of my photoshoots were unprepared with no planned poses. However, with that in mind, I can take as many pictures as you would like and will edit them for you. Also, I am only limited to Houston, TX.
                </p>

                    Currently, Photography has been a hobby to me. I enjoy taking these pictures as they help me improve on my skills. That being said, all of my photos have been taken and edited by me free of charge. I would like to one day reach the point where I believe my photos are worthy of something, but as of right now, I only take donations.
                </p>
