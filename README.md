# Ando Photography
 
In my free time, I like to take pictures for my peers during Anime Conventions. It's one of my favourite hobbies because I get to capture amazing cosplays for them so they can showcase their cosplays for others. I wanted a place to share all the photos I've taken because it makes it easier to find out what pictures I've taken.

I also wanted to make a place for them to download all of their photos. Sure, I can just share a link, but learning how to make a website with passwords to download seemed pretty cool.  Of course, that required me to learn how create a password system to get the download link. In the future, I would like to expand this website so that I can store files in a NAS for download to save money.

One of the main challenges for this project was creating a photo grid. I needed to utilize JavaScript to automate a process to read an entire photo to create the grid. That way, I wouldn't have had to individually type out each file.
